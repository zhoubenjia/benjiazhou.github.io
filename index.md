## Biography
I received the B.Eng. degree from the Minzu University of China, Beijing, China, in 2019, and I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.
My research interests focus on action/gesture recognition and sign language recognition/translation/generation and skeleton-based action generation.

## Research Interests
Computer Vision · Deep Learning · Video Understanding · Motion Recognition · Sign Language Translation

## Selected Awards and Honors
